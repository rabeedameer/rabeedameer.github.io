          After leaving my country and moving to Germany in 2015, my life was totally changed and I couldn't start working as a teacher again and also I have seen such a huge upward trend in tech and web development world. So without hesitation, I decided to have a new start with a new challenge. then the opportunity appeared at&nbsp; 
          <abbr title="Digital Carrier Center">DCI </abbr>&nbsp;in Berlin and I could start my first step being a web developer.
        </p>
      </section>
      <More/>
      <Coding/>
    </Fragment>);
